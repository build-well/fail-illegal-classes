# Gradle Calculator

A simple, foundational [gradle](https://gradle.org/) java project for examples.

## Structure

Every example forked from this repository has a solo-project (default) branch
and a multi-project branch. The multi-project examples include a
`settings.gradle` file, the root project, and two sub-projects.

Often plugin configuration will differ depending on the structure of the
repository, raising common questions like:

1. Where should the plugin be applied?
2. How can configuration be shared?
